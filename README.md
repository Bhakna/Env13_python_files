# Env13_python_files
This repo contains all the files for the python_jupyter_notebook module of Tech_Ambience vertical for Envisage_13 summer training.

# Training path
Env13_python_jupyter -> this file consists of general introduction to jupyter notebooks and its installation

Lesson_1-3 -> These three files contain code for basic python

Lesson_4 -> This file is an intro to matplotlib and 2D visualization of data

Lesson_5 -> This file gives an intro to numpy arrays and optimization using scipy

Lesson_6 -> This file has code representing linear algebra and matrix manipulation


# Task 1 :
You will be given a csv file called "task_1_data.csv". Take the data from the file into your jupyter notebook. 

Use the data to plot a figure. Using the figure, guess which function the data represents. Use scipy to fit the data into your guess function. 

Provide the fitted parameters and calculate error. 

Comment whether your function truly represents the data provided to you.

# Task 2 :
For your second task, you will be calculating the value of pi using 2D visualization.

You have to plot an ellipse inside a rectangle as shown in figure.

# Task 3 :

# Submission 
The deadline for submission is 12 EOD (end of day).

You are supposed to submit only ONE .ipynb file with format "rollno_name_pyhton.ipynb". An example is - "ch22b008_aayush_python.ipynb".

The submitted file should contain all three task solutions. You may beautify the code using 'Markdown' mode if you wish to.

You may search for hints/solutions in the python documentation. (Recommended)

You may go through research papers or GitHub repos.

You may use other websites on the internet for hints/solutions.

All the very best.
