# Env13_python_files
This repo contains all the files for the python_jupyter_notebook module of Tech_Ambience vertical for Envisage_13 summer training.

# Training path
Env13_python_jupyter -> this file consists of general introduction to jupyter notebooks and its installation

Lesson_1-3 -> These three files contain code for basic python

Lesson_4 -> This file is an intro to matplotlib and 2D visualization of data

Lesson_5 -> This file gives an intro to numpy arrays and optimization using scipy

Lesson_6 -> This file has code representing linear algebra and matrix manipulation

# Tasks
There are three tasks for this module.

Task_1

You will be given a csv data file. Take the data from the file into your jupyter notebook. Use the data to plot a figure. Using the figure, guess which function the data represents. Use scipy to fit the data into your guess function. Comment whether your function truly represents the data provided to you.

Task_2
