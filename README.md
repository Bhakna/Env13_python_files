# Env13_python_files
This repo contains all the files for the python_jupyter_notebook module of Tech_Ambience vertical for Envisage_13 summer training.

# Training path
Env13_python_jupyter -> this file consists of general introduction to jupyter notebooks and its installation

Lesson_1-3 -> These three files contain code for basic python

Lesson_4 -> This file is an intro to matplotlib and 2D visualization of data

Lesson_5 -> This file gives an intro to numpy arrays and optimization using scipy

Lesson_6 -> This file has code representing linear algebra and matrix manipulation


# Task 1 : 25 points
You will be given a csv file called "task_1_data.csv". Take the data from the file into your jupyter notebook. 

Use the data to plot a figure. Using the figure, guess which function the data represents. Use scipy to fit the data into your guess function. 

Provide the fitted parameters and calculate error. 

Comment whether your function truly represents the data provided to you.

# Task 2 : 25 points
For your second task, you will be calculating the value of pi.

You have to plot an ellipse inside a rectangle as shown below in figure.

Next, you will randomly scatter about 10000 points inside the rectangle. If a point lies inside the ellipse, color it green, otherwise color it red. Afterwards plot the figure again. It should look something like this-

Calculate the experimental value of pi. [Hint: 'no of points' appx represents 'area covered'] 

What is the error in this value of pi?

Repeat this process for different no of points. How does change in no of points effect the error in value of pi?

Is this method of calculating pi good or bad? Give comments.


# Task 3 : 50 points
For the final task, you will be doing 2D visualization of temperature change.

Assume that there are two infinite slabs of some metal kept at a certain distance from each other in vacuum, as shown in figure.

![alt text](https://github.com/Bhakna/Env13_python_files/blob/main/task_3_slabs.jpeg?raw=true)

The upper slab is at a fixed temperature of 300°C, whereas the lower is at a fixed temperature of 100°C. Assume that the initial temperature of the space in between the two slabs is 0°C.

Visualize how the temperature will change in between the two slabs with time.

You may use any of the python libraries/modules, even those which we have not discussed about.


# Submission 
The deadline for submission has been extended to 13 EOD (end of day).

You are supposed to submit only ONE .ipynb file with format "rollno_name_pyhton.ipynb". An example is - "ch22b008_aayush_python.ipynb".

The submitted file should contain all three task solutions. You may beautify the code using 'Markdown' mode if you wish to.

You may search for hints/solutions in the python documentation. (Recommended)

You may go through research papers or GitHub repos.

You may use other websites on the internet for hints/solutions.

All the very best.
